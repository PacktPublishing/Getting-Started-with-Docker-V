# Getting Started With Docker

Docker is an open source containerization engine that offers a simple and faster way for developing and running software. Docker containers wrap software in a complete file system that contains everything it needs to run, enabling any application to be run anywhere – this flexibility and portability mean that you can run apps in the cloud, on virtual machines, or on dedicated servers.
# What You Will Learn:
 * Develop containerized applications using Docker
 * Write a Docker file, build an image from it, and then launch a container from that image
 * Get familiar with common Docker tasks such as pushing images to remote repositories
 * Use Docker Services to run a group of related Docker containers 
 * Share data between containers
 # Key Features:
 * This comprehensive video tutorial will show you how to leverage Docker’s features to deploy your existing applications
 * Package your applications with Docker and build, ship, and scale your containers
 * Explore the key concepts such as port mappings and the image caching layer used during builds
